# Connected-component-labelling-using-Two-scan-algorithm
Here providing a python connected component labelling using two scan algorithm
working flow of the two pass algorithm in(4 point and 8 point connectivity for a 5x5 binary matrix and also for an Binary Image)Taking a binary Image and applying the two scan algorithm to it get the labelled Image.
